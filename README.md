**Skočko Combination Guesser**

---

## Overview
Welcome to the Skočko Combination Guesser repository! Here, you'll find an implementation of a combination guesser for the Serbian game show Slagalica's game, Skočko. Skočko is akin to the classic board game Mastermind, challenging players to deduce a secret combination of symbols within a limited number of attempts. This project endeavors to crack the code using various algorithms and strategies, aiming for efficient and effective guessing.

## How to Play Skočko
In Skočko, players confront a hidden combination of four symbols from a predefined set. The goal is to unveil this sequence within a set number of tries. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of pegs:
- A red peg denotes a correct symbol in the correct position.
- A yellow peg signifies a correct symbol but in the wrong position

Leveraging this feedback, players refine their guesses until uncovering the secret combination or running out of attempts.

## Implementation Details
The Skočko Combination Guesser is written in Java and comprises three key components:

1. **Game Logic**: Establishes the game's rules, evaluates the user's answers, and furnishes feedback.
2. **Solver Algorithms**: Implements a strategy inspired by Donald Knuth's five-guess algorithm.
3. **User Interface (Optional)**: Features a user-friendly interface facilitating interaction, enabling users to input answers while the program guesses their combinations.

## Contributing
Your contributions to this project are highly valued! Whether you're keen on implementing novel solver algorithms, refining existing code, or enhancing the user interface, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues. Your input is invaluable in refining the Skočko Combination Guesser.

## Acknowledgments
This project draws inspiration from the Serbian game show Slagalica and the intriguing game Skočko. A heartfelt thank you goes out to the contributors and developers of Mastermind solver algorithms, whose work underpins this project.
